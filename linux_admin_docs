Use interfaces to trace if forwarding packets are coming to the local network or going out the local network

Allow all the traffic when Machine wants to talk to itself (lo interface):
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT (At top)

iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -j ACCEPT(eth0 inteface at top of rules)

block all icmp packets except the four mentioned in the lecture slides 

Question lab6: DROP all other inbound (e.g. if the input interface is eth0) FORWARDed traffic?

Deleted crontab, is that ok?

Removes ACCEPTin /etc??  iptables -A INPUT -s 100.64.0.0/16 -j ACCEPT
